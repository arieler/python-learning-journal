# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

ABOUT ME:
I'm a 17-year-old coder from the Bay Area with a passion for technology and problem-solving. I've taught myself Python and have essentially taught myself Java as well, thanks to a less-than-helpful teacher. My hard work paid off with a score of 5 on the AP Computer Science A exam, proving my dedication and skill in programming. I love tackling new challenges and am always eager to learn and grow in the ever-evolving field of computer science.

GOALS FOR THIS COURSE: 
  - get an A
  - understand everything thats being taught
  - not miss any classes
  - submit everything on time
  - put my all into this class
  - ENJOY THE CLASS
